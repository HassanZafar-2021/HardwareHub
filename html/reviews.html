            "The store have everything you want. And there is someone ready to
            assist you all the time. It's very easy to locate whenever u want to
            buy unlike all those big stores that u have to walk for several
            hours to locate what u want. And most time, no one is ready to
            assist you. I found out that it's even cheaper there than the big
            stores. The staffs here are friendly and care for their customers."

            construction related). Has pretty useful things that you might need
